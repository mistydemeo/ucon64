The original uCON for SNES and Genesis was written by chicken & chp in ~1995<br>
<br>
<p>
<a name="190">1.9.0</a><br>
- completely re-written<br>
- this is the first real version with support for the most consoles<br>
<p>
<a name="191">1.9.1</a><br>
- bug fixes<br>
- fixed the -xv64 routine for receive and emulation on N64<br>

  be a USB device with copyprotected MPE standard instead of MP3.. HAHAHAHA!!!)<br>
- TODO:  -xmp3 send MP3 file(s) to SongBoy (MP3 player for Game Boy)<br>
- removed options which were added by mistake (like parallel transfer for Z64)<br>

  emulator for the Nintendo64<br>

  grnnn...) "You gotta do what you gotta do." (Futurama)<br>

  uCON64 version he uses has new database entries for a console system<br>
