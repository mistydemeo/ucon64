<a name="1"><b>Q1</b>: Why uCON64?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: uCON64 is designed for people who want to play all the games on the
   original hardware. Here you got a powerful tool to backup, restore games and
   for many other operations. It is just a keep-old-hardware-alive tool :-)<br>
   But besides this it <i>can</i> operate as an intelligent frontend for every
   available emulator.<br>
<br>
<p>
<a name="2"><b>Q2</b>: How do I compile uCON64?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: To create a DOS executable you'll need
   <a href="http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/" target="_blank">DJGPP</a>,
   a DOS port of gcc and other GNU development tools.<br>
   To create a Win32 executable you'll need
   <a href="http://www.cygwin.com" target="_blank">Cygwin</a>,
   a Windows port of gcc and many other GNU tools and libraries.<br>
   uCON64 1.9.8 can also be build with Visual C++. See below the "GNU help" for
   further instructions.
<br>
   If you use a Bash compatible shell first enter the following line:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; ./configure<br>
<br>
   Pass the option --without-zlib to the configure script if you don't want to
   enable gzip &amp; zip support. zlib is available from
   <a href="http://www.gzip.org/zlib/" target="_blank">http://www.gzip.org/zlib/</a>.<br>
   If you use a Bash incompatible shell (like command.com or cmd.exe), copy
   Makefile.orig to Makefile, libdiscmage/Makefile.orig to libdiscmage/Makefile
   and config.h.orig to config.h.<br>
   Now you can optionally open Makefile and config.h in an editor and
   change the defines.<br>
<br>
   For DJGPP and Cygwin you should either copy the file libgcc.a to the
   standard library directory or edit libdiscmage/Makefile so that the
   variable GCCA_DIR points to the directory that contains libgcc.a.<br>
   If you don't intend to use the functionality that libdiscmage provides you
   could skip the previous step and pass the argument "ucon64" (without the
   quotes) as argument to make ("ucon64.exe" on WinDOS). So instead of just
   typing "make" type "make ucon64".<br>
   Note that if you want to enable zlib support under DOS you must define the
   constant HAVE_ZLIB_H in config.h (remove the "//" in front of the line that
   defines it) <i>and</i> ZLIB in Makefile and libdiscmage/Makefile.<br>
   Then enter the following lines:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; make clean<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; make<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; make install<br>
<br>
   On Unix systems other than Linux you might need to use 'gmake' instead of
   'make'. Under Unix the last command will ask for root's password, because
   uCON64 needs to be setuid root for parallel port access. Under BeOS the last
   command will open a dialog window. Just follow the instructions. Under DOS
   and Windows (but also under Unix and BeOS) you can find the executable in
   the directory where you ran make.<br>
   To build uCON64 with Visual C++, first copy config.h.vc6 to config.h. If you
   want to enable zlib support you should follow the same steps as when using
   the GNU tools with the exception that you should edit Makefile.vc6 and
   libdiscmage/Makefile.vc6. Then start a command prompt, go to the correct
   directory and enter the following lines:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; nmake -f Makefile.vc6 clean<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; nmake -f Makefile.vc6<br>
<br>
   If you don't want to compile libdiscmage pass "ucon64.exe" as argument to
   nmake:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; nmake -f Makefile.vc6 ucon64.exe<br>
<br>
   You could use UPX to compress the executable. UPX is available from
   <a href="http://upx.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">http://upx.sourceforge.net</a>.<br>
<br>
<p>
<a name="3"><b>Q3</b>: How do I install uCON64?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: You already did if you followed the directions in the previous answer
   (you downloaded the source package). If you don't use WinDOS run install.sh
   (Unix) or install_beos.sh (BeOS) and edit $HOME/.ucon64rc. If you use WinDOS
   you may want to copy ucon64.exe to a directory in your PATH and maybe edit
   ucon64.cfg.<br>
   If you use DOS or Windows&nbsp;9x and don't want uCON64 to create ucon64.cfg
   or .ucon64rc files all over the place (current directories) see
   <a href="#24">question 24</a>.<br>
   You might also want to make use of DAT files. See
   <a href="#35">question 35</a> for more information.<br>
<br>
   For copier I/O BeOS users will need Caz's driver inside ioport.zip or
   available at
   <a href="http://www.infernal.currantbun.com" target="_blank">http://www.infernal.currantbun.com</a>.<br>
   Windows&nbsp;NT/2000/XP users might also need a driver. You could use
   GiveIO, UserPort or inpout32.dll. At
   <a href="http://www.devrs.com/gba/files/mbv2faqs.php" target="_blank">http://www.devrs.com/gba/files/mbv2faqs.php</a>
   you can find links to GiveIO and UserPort. You can find inpout32.dll in a
   file named parport.zip at
   <a href="http://www.logix4u.cjb.net" target="_blank">http://www.logix4u.cjb.net</a>
   or
   <a href="http://www.geocities.com/logix4u/" target="_blank">http://www.geocities.com/logix4u/</a>.
   GiveIO is plainly horrible to configure. We recommend UserPort and
   inpout32.dll. They are also included with the binary release. With GiveIO
   sending ROMs seems to go faster than with UserPort, but UserPort is much
   easier to use. To install inpout32.dll, put it in uCON64's configuration
   directory. Use the option -version to see which directory that is. You can
   change the directory by editing the configuration file or by setting an
   environment variable with the name configdir. Note however, that although
   inpout32.dll is even easier to use than UserPort the transfer speed is much
   lower (about half as fast compared to the transfer speed in combination with
   UserPort). uCON64 will display a message if it finds inpout32.dll before
   communicating with a copier. It displays this message before it displays
   file information, so you might want to use the command line switch -q. Only
   the Windows versions of uCON64 are able to use inpout32.dll.<br>
   It <i>is</i> possible to use uCON64 as a transfer tool under Windows&nbsp;XP
   without GiveIO, UserPort or inpout32.dll. We have had reports from
   people who were able to send and receive ROMs under Windows&nbsp;XP as a
   regular user (no Administrator rights and not "Power Users").<br>

<a name="4"><b>Q4</b>: Sometimes my terminal seems to be locked after "ucon64 -xswc &#60;file&#62; | more"</a><br>
<b>A</b>: You are right, it <u>seems</u> to be locked, but the only thing that happened is
   that the character echoing of the terminal is disabled by more. Just don't do that ;-)<br>
<br>
<p>
<a name="5"><b>Q5</b>: How do I make uCON64 display only information about a ROM?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: If you want to display information about a ROM just run uCON64 with the name of
   the ROM as the only argument. Note that sometimes you will have to specify the console
   type for uCON64, because the ROM dump is damaged or simply not detected correctly by
   uCON64. For example:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; ucon64 -snes "Super Aleste (J) [t1].swc"<br>
<br>
<p>
<a name="6"><b>Q6</b>: I have two parallel ports in my PC and my Flash Advance
   Linker is connected to the second. However, when I try to use uCON64 to send
   a demo to the FAL something goes wrong. What happened?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: Well, many things could have gone wrong, but uCON64 only detects your
   first parallel port (it stops probing for a parallel port if it finds one).
   So, you should specify the address of the second parallel port on the command
   line. For example:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; ucon64 -xfal demo.gba -port 0x278<br>
<br>
   The I/O address of the parallel port can be 0x3bc, 0x378 or 0x278. If you
   don't want to type the address of the parallel port everytime you want to
   transfer something to your FAL (or another copier) edit .ucon64rc or
   ucon64.cfg (for the DOS version) and remove the hash symbol in front of the
   line that starts with "parport=" (without the quotes). If that line isn't
   present add one. You don't have to use the prefix 0x. For example:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; parport=278<br>
   You can also set an environment variable with the name parport to the right
   value. Note that the value of the environment variable takes precedence over
   the value in the configuration file.<br>
<br>
<p>
<a name="7"><b>Q7</b>: I tried to dump a SNES cartridge using a Super Wild Card connected to my PC with an
   interlink cable, but it didn't work. What's wrong?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: You shouldn't use an interlink cable, but a standard bidirectional parallel cable,
   i.e., a cable with male DB-25 connectors at both ends where the pins are connected in the
   following way:<br>
   pin 1&nbsp; &#60;-&#62; pin 1<br>
   pin 2&nbsp; &#60;-&#62; pin 2<br>
   pin 3&nbsp; &#60;-&#62; pin 3<br>
   pin 4&nbsp; &#60;-&#62; pin 4<br>
   pin 5&nbsp; &#60;-&#62; pin 5<br>
   pin 6&nbsp; &#60;-&#62; pin 6<br>
   pin 7&nbsp; &#60;-&#62; pin 7<br>
   pin 8&nbsp; &#60;-&#62; pin 8<br>
   pin 9&nbsp; &#60;-&#62; pin 9<br>
   pin 10 &#60;-&#62; pin 10<br>
   pin 11 &#60;-&#62; pin 11<br>
   pin 12 &#60;-&#62; pin 12<br>
   pin 13 &#60;-&#62; pin 13<br>
   pin 15 &#60;-&#62; pin 15<br>
   pin 25 &#60;-&#62; pin 25<br>
   The other pins may be left unconnected. Pins 2-9 are used for output, pins 10-13 & 15 for input
   and pin 25 is ground.<br>
<br>
<p>
<a name="8"><b>Q8</b>: I have a SNES ROM of which GoodSNES says it's good, but
   uCON64 says it's bad. Who is right?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: GoodSNES.<br>
   There may be several reasons why uCON64 reports that the checksum is bad.
   It could have made a mistake while determining if the ROM is a HiROM or a
   LoROM dump. Try the switches -hi and -nhi and see if uCON64 reports the
   checksum differently. A bigger problem is that the interleave detection code
   (stolen from Snes9x ;-) is not reliable. Especially BS ROMs are often
   detected as not being interleaved while they actually are. Try the switches
   -int and -int2 and see if you get better results. If the checksum is
   reported as good it is very likely that the ROM is really good.
   Alternatively, you may want to convert the ROM to a non-interleaved format
   with -dint and run uCON64 on the converted ROM. That gives the best results.
   Luckily you won't find many interleaved ROM dumps that uCON64 can't
   handle, probably because Snes9x and ZSNES often can't handle them either.<br>
<br>
<p>
<a name="9"><b>Q9</b>: I have a SNES ROM of which Snes9x and ZSNES say it's bad, but uCON64 says it's good.
   Who is right?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: uCON64, probably :-)<br>
   Neither Snes9x 1.39 nor ZSNES 1.36 calculate the checksum correctly for BS ROMs, so you
   can be pretty sure the ROM is good if it's a BS ROM. See previous answer.<br>
<br>
<p>
<a name="10"><b>Q10</b>: I have a SNES ROM of which uCON64 said it was bad, so
   I used the -chk option. Now uCON64, Snes9x and ZSNES all say the ROM is
   good, but GoodSNES still says it's bad. How can that be, I did fix the ROM,
   right?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: No, you did not. When you use -chk uCON64 changes four bytes in the
   ROM dump, so that they match with the calculated checksum. However, the ROM
   stays just as bad as it was.<br>
   Use -chk with care. -chk might be useful if you want to store a ROM
   somewhere without using a database with its checksum. You can then later
   check if the ROM is still the same as it was when you stored it by using the
   checksum that is stored in the ROM.<br>
<br>
<p>
<a name="11"><b>Q11</b>: Some SNES games don't work on my Super Wild Card.
   What can I do about that?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: You can do several things. First make sure the original game
   cartridge doesn't contain any special chips that your Super Wild Card
   doesn't support (look at the ROM type information). For example, if you are
   trying to upload a game like Super Mario Kart (which uses a DSP chip) your
   Super Wild Card should have an extension with the correct DSP chip (or have
   the right cartridge with that chip plugged in your SWC). Then, make sure you
   are using a good dump (look at the checksum information). Also verify that
   the backup header is correct. The option -dbuh can be helpful for that. You
   can make uCON64 rewrite the header with -swc. uCON64 uses the information in
   the ROM dump's header, so this is important! You can also try to rewrite the
   header while using one of the switches -hi or -nhi to force uCON64 to handle
   it as a HiROM or a LoROM dump. Additionally you could use one of the
   switches -hd, -nhd or -hdn to specify the backup unit header size. For
   example:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; ucon64 -swc -nhi -hd "Batman Revenge of the Joker (U).swc"<br>
   There are many (good) ROMs on the internet with incorrect headers, so this
   might well solve the problem.<br>
   Several games contain a copy protection that prevents them from running on
   a backup unit, so this can also be a reason why the game doesn't work. You
   can try -k to remove that protection. Several games also check if they are
   running on a PAL or an NTSC SNES. Use -f to remove that form of copy
   protection. Some other games check the ROM speed. You can use -l for those.
   Note that some games have more than one type of copy protection, so it might
   be necessary to use uCON64 several times with a different option.<br>
   See <a href="#38">question 38</a> and <a href="#39">question 39</a> for more
   information about a new feature in uCON64 1.9.8beta8 that can be used to
   update or improve the options -k, -f and -l without having to (re)compile
   the source code.<br>
<br>
   Some games seem to work, but after a while it becomes clear that they don't
   run as was intended. Two examples of such games are Demon's Crest and Mega
   Man X. Here follows an explanation on how to get them to work. All credits
   go to Gideon Zhi for sharing this info on cherryroms. Start with ROM images
   in SWC format.<br>
<br>
   Demon's Crest:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; ucon64 -stp "Demon's Crest.swc"<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; cat "Demon's Crest.swc" "Demon's Crest.swc" &#62; "Demon's Crest (SWC-fix).swc"<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; ucon64 -swc "Demon's Crest (SWC-fix).swc"<br>
<br>
   Mega Man X:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; ucon64 -stp "Mega Man X.swc"<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; ucon64 -padn=2097152 "Mega Man X.swc"<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; cat "Mega Man X.swc" "Mega Man X.swc" &#62; "Mega Man X (SWC-fix).swc"<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; ucon64 -swc "Mega Man X (SWC-fix).swc"<br>
<br>
   WinDOS users without the program cat should use the command copy. For
   example:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; copy /b "Mega Man X.swc" + "Mega Man X.swc" "Mega Man X (SWC-fix).swc"<br>
<br>
   However, starting from version 1.9.8beta6 the method described above isn't
   necessary anymore for Demon's Crest. Use the option -k instead. For
   Mega Man X you will need version 1.9.8beta7 or later.<br>
<br>
   Finally, you could have a look at an (incomplete) Super Wild Card
   compatibility list on the uCON64 homepage (it can also be found in the
   source package) to see if it is possible to run a certain game on a Super
   Wild Card <u>2.8cc 32 Mbit PAL</u>.<br>

<a name="17"><b>Q17</b>: What does "[ROM|IMAGE|SRAM|FILE|DIR|ARCHIVE]..." mean

<b>A</b>: The pipe symbol ('|') should be read as "or".<br>
   The square brackets indicate that "ROM|IMAGE|SRAM|FILE|DIR|ARCHIVE" is
   optional. For many options you have to specify either a ROM or a CD image or
   an SRAM file or some other file or a directory or an archive. However, there
   are a few options that don't need any of those arguments.<br>
   The elipses indicate that you may specify one or more ROMs, CD images etc.
   Several options even support combinations of ROMs, directories and
   archives.<br>
   For the current version of uCON64, archive should be read as "ZIP file".<br>

<a name="18"><b>Q18</b>: Why is my backup unit (still) not supported?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: Get us the protocol or the sources of existing transfer tools and you'll
   see what happens. uCON64 already supports all important backup units which
   were and are available. Manufacturers of devices which are still not
   supported are welcome to contact us.<br>

<a name="19"><b>Q19</b>: How do I specify a bank number for the GB Xchanger?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: ucon64 -xgbxb &#60;0&#62; "Pokemon (Green).sav" wouldn't work.
   You should leave out those angle brackets. This should work:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; ucon64 -xgbxb 0 "Pokemon (Green).sav"<br>

<a name="20"><b>Q20</b>: What's the difference between the Flash Advance Linker
   options -xfals and -xfalb &#60;n&#62;?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: When saving -xfals saves all 256 kB while -xfalb &#60;n&#62; saves
   only the 64 kB of bank n. When restoring -xfals starts restoring the SRAM in
   bank 1 while -xfalb &#60;n&#62; starts in bank n. For example, if you have
   Super Mario Advance 2 (J) in your Flash Card in "ROM bank" 4 (GBA Pack) and
   would like to save/restore SRAM bank 4 you should do something like:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; ucon64 -xfalb 4 "Super Mario Advance 2 (J).sav"<br>
   Note that the file size determines how many bytes are restored, even when
   you use -xfalb &#60;n&#62;. So, if the file is greater than 64 kB more than
   one bank will be written to.<br>
<br>
<p>
<a name="21"><b>Q21</b>: uCON64 exits with the message "Flash cart erase failed!" when I try
   to write a multirom to my flash card. What's wrong?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: The multirom file you created is too large for your flash card. When you make a
   multirom file don't forget that the loader or "game pack" file also needs some space (32
   kB) on the flash card. Don't pass a size to -multi that is larger than your flash card.
   Passing a smaller size is correct too. For example, to create a multirom that fits on a
   128 Mb (16 MB) card use a command line like this:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; ucon64 -multi=128 loader.bin rom1.gba rom2.gba rom3.gba rom4.gba multi.bin<br>
   You can also send it directly by using -xfalmulti:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; ucon64 -xfalmulti=128 loader.bin rom1.gba rom2.gba rom3.gba rom4.gba<br>
   Just like sometimes happens with Visoly's tool it is possible to get the same message when the
   multirom is small enough. It will probably work when you try again (with the same multirom).<br>
<br>
<p>
<a name="22"><b>Q22</b>: Where can I get that loader or "game pack" file?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: You can get it from <a href="http://www.visoly.com" target="_blank">Visoly's site</a>.
   It's in a file with a name like <a href="http://www.visoly.com/download/preboot32.zip">preboot32.zip</a>.<br>

<a name="23"><b>Q23</b>: What is the meaning of the -col option (SNES)?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: Back in the days stupid people released games with green blood.
   You can use a GFX or HTML editor to find an identical green color and
   write down the color values in HTML style (#RRGGBB). Now you run
   "ucon64 -col #RRGGBB" and it will calculate the hex value for the corresponding
   SNES color. Ok? No? Then you don't need this option :-)<br>
<br>
<p>
<a name="24"><b>Q24</b>: Why does uCON64 create ucon64.cfg (DOS executable) or
   .ucon64rc (Win32 executable) files all over the place under DOS and
   Windows&nbsp;9x (command.com)?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: uCON64 needs to know where it can find the configuration file or a
   directory where it can create one. It checks the environment for a variable
   with the name HOME, USERPROFILE or HOMEDRIVE and HOMEPATH (in that order).
   Under Unix HOME is normally set. Under Windows&nbsp;XP and 2000 (NT?)
   USERPROFILE, HOMEDRIVE and HOMEPATH are usually set. If uCON64 can't find
   one of those environment variables it will look for the configuration file
   in the current directory. If it can't find a configuration file it will
   create one. Under DOS and Windows&nbsp;9x none of those environment
   variables are usually set. So, if you run uCON64 under DOS or
   Windows&nbsp;9x in a directory where no configuration file exists it will
   create one there. If you don't like this behaviour you should set one of the
   mentioned environment variables yourself. You can do that by adding the
   following line to the end of the file c:\autoexec.bat:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; set HOME=c:\ucon64<br>
   and reboot. You can also type that line on the command line. The directory
   c:\ucon64 must exist, of course. If you want uCON64 to use another directory
   you should change c:\ucon64 to a directory of your choice. Note that you
   should not let the last character of the environment variable be a forward
   or backward slash.<br>
   If you have Cygwin installed, the Cygwin runtime system will create an
   internal environment for the uCON64 executable with HOME set to Cygwin's
   home directory if it has not already been set. You can override this value
   with the method mentioned earlier.<br>
   You can check which configuration file uCON64 uses by specifying the option
   -version on the command line.<br>
<br>
<p>
<a name="25"><b>Q25</b>: When I try to create a multirom under Windows I get the message
   "The system cannot execute the specified program." (or something like that).
   What does that mean?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: You can get that message with the DOS executable if you pass more than 127
   characters as argument to uCON64. There are two solutions:<br>
   1.) Use the Win32 executable (download it from
   <a href="http://ucon64.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">the uCON64 homepage</a>).<br>
   2.) Rename the ROMs so that their combined names are short enough to fit into 127 characters.<br>
<br>
<p>
<a name="26"><b>Q26</b>: I tried to run the Win32 executable of uCON64 but
   Windows gave an error message that cygwin1.dll, cygz.dll or zlib.dll could
   not be found.</a><br>
<b>A</b>: The Cygwin-compiled Win32 executable of uCON64 needs cygwin1.dll and
   cygz.dll in order to run. The Visual C++-compiled Win32 executable (the
   "official" Win32 executable) needs zlib.dll. You can download these files
   from
   <a href="http://ucon64.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">the uCON64 homepage</a>.
   Copy the file(s) to the same directory as the uCON64 executable or to a
   directory in your PATH.<br>
<br>
<p>
<a name="27"><b>Q27</b>: How do I make uCON64 display one help screen at a time?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: Just as is stated in the last few lines of the help, pass the output of uCON64
   to a program that waits for a key after one screen of text. You could use the program
   "more". In order to pass the output of uCON64 to more you have to use the pipe symbol,
   '|'. On an international keyboard you can type this symbol with the same key you use
   for the backslash ('\'). For example:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; ucon64 -help|more<br>
   To get only help on the options for a specific console, specify the console on the
   command line. For example, to see only the help on Game Boy Advance options:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; ucon64 -help -gba|more<br>
   Press the space bar to see the next help screen, the enter key to see the next line
   or q to quit.<br>

<a name="28"><b>Q28</b>: I tried to send a ROM dump to my copier under
   Windows&nbsp;XP (NT/2000), but uCON64 crashed. What's wrong?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: If the message looks like this (for the Win32 (Cygwin) executable):<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; 0 [main] ucon64 356 handle_exceptions: Exception: STATUS_PRIVILEGED_INSTRUCTION<br>
   5570 [main] ucon64 356 open_stackdumpfile: Dumping stack trace to ucon64.exe.stackdump<br>
   or like this:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; Illegal instruction (core dumped)<br>
   then you didn't install an I/O driver (correctly). Note that in this case
   "install" means that the I/O driver is running at the time uCON64 tries to
   access the parallel port. See <a href="#3">question 3</a>.<br>
   You will also see this message if you tried to enable EPP mode for the FAL
   under Windows XP (NT/2000), i.e., you specified the switch -xfalm, without
   an appropriate I/O port driver. UserPort is <i>inappropriate</i> for this,
   because it enables access to I/O ports up to 0x3ff. However, in order to
   enable EPP mode the FAL code tries to access an I/O port with an address
   higher than 0x3ff. If you want to be able to use EPP mode try inpout32.dll.<br>

<a name="30"><b>Q30</b>: How do I convert a NES ROM from Pasofami to FFE? Or from
   UNIF to Pasofami?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: Use iNES as intermediate format. So, to do the conversion Pasofami
   -&#62; FFE, do this conversion instead: first Pasofami -&#62; iNES and then
   iNES -&#62; FFE.<br>
   To answer the second question, to do the conversion UNIF -&#62; Pasofami do
   this: UNIF -&#62; iNES and then iNES -&#62; Pasofami.<br>
<br>
<p>
<a name="31"><b>Q31</b>: How do I specify dumper information when converting to UNIF?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: Create a text file with three lines. The first line should contain
   the name (or "handle") of the person who dumped the cartridge. This line may
   be 99 characters long at maximum. The next line should contain the date when
   the cartridge was dumped. The format is dd-mm-yyyy. Instead of the hyphen
   ('-') you may also use the slash ('/'). If day or month is smaller than 10
   you may use 1 or 2 digits, for example:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; 02/02/2002<br>
   or<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; 2-2-2002<br>
   The third and last line should contain information about the dumping means
   that was used. This line may also contain 99 characters at maximum. Here is
   an example info file:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; Dirk &#60;noisyb@gmx.net&#62;<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; 26-7-2002<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; Custom built hardware<br>
   To get this information in a UNIF file, you should use the -dumpinfo switch
   in combination with the -unif option. Say you store the dumper information
   in the file info.txt. This would get the info in a UNIF file:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; ucon64 -unif smb.nes -mapr NROM -dumpinfo info.txt<br>
   If you already have a UNIF file the command line looks almost the same:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; ucon64 -unif smb.unf -dumpinfo info.txt<br>
   For an existing UNIF file you needn't specify the board name, but you might
   want to specify it if you want to change the board name in the file.
   Afterwards run uCON64 on the newly written ROM to see if you were
   successful. uCON64's display output should contain a dump info section then.<br>
<br>
<p>
<a name="32"><b>Q32</b>: How do I specify that a NES game in UNIF format
   supports multiple controller types?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: Use the -ctrl switch multiple times on the <b>same</b> command line.
   For example, to specify that a game supports the controller types "regular
   joypad" and "power pad" you would use a command line like this:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; ucon64 -unif smb.nes -mapr NROM -ctrl 0 -ctrl 4<br>
<br>
<p>
<a name="33"><b>Q33</b>: How do I enable or disable colors in the display
   output of uCON64?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: For the Windows and Unix executables colors are enabled by default.
   For the DOS executable ANSI.SYS must be loaded. Under DOS and
   Windows&nbsp;9x ANSI.SYS can be loaded by adding a line to the end of
   c:\config.sys of the format "device=&#60;full path to ANSI.SYS&#62;".
   Say ANSI.SYS is located in the directory c:\windows\command, then the line
   would have to look like this:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; device=c:\windows\command\ansi.sys<br>
   Note that changes made to config.sys under DOS and Windows&nbsp;9x will
   become active only after a reboot.<br>
   Under Windows&nbsp;XP/NT you should add a similar line to your
   %SystemRoot%\system32\CONFIG.NT:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; device=%SystemRoot%\system32\ansi.sys<br>
   The use of color can be disabled by specifying the switch -ncol on the
   command line. You can also add the following line to the config file:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; ansi_color=0<br>
<br>
<p>
<a name="34"><b>Q34</b>: When I try to convert a large number of files using
   wildcards, uCON64 will only convert the first file. Is this a bug?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: No, it isn't. uCON64 versions before 1.9.8beta7 just don't support
   wildcards. For example, to convert all files with the suffix (M$ speak:
   extension) .mgd to Super Wild Card format, try this in Bash:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; find -name \*.mgd -exec ucon64 --snes --swc {} \;<br>
   or this in command.com or cmd.exe:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; for %f in (*.mgd) do ucon64 --snes --swc "%f"<br>
   However, this funtionality has been added to uCON64 1.9.8beta7. With that
   version you can do the same thing with:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; ucon64 --snes --swc *.mgd<br>
   In case something goes terribly wrong and uCON64 crashes it might still be
   necessary to use one of the previous methods, because every file will be
   processed and not only the files before the crash.<br>
<br>
<p>
<a name="35"><b>Q35</b>: Does uCON64 support DAT (Goodxxxx, RomCenter, etc.)
   files?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: Yes, starting with version 1.9.8beta8 it does. First use the option
   -version to see which configuration file uCON64 uses
   (see <a href="#24">question 24</a>). Then open that file in an editor and
   look for a line that starts with "datdir=" (without the quotes). If that
   line isn't present add one. For example on Unix:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; datdir=~/.ucon64/dat<br>
   or on Windows:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; datdir=c:\ucon64\dat<br>
   You can use the tilde ('~') also on DOS and Windows. It will be interpreted
   by uCON64 as the "home directory". The home directory is the directory
   specified by the environment variable HOME or USERPROFILE or HOMEDRIVE and
   HOMEPATH. If none of those environment variables are set, the current
   directory will be handled as the home directory. Again, see
   <a href="#24">question 24</a>.<br>
   You can also set an environment variable with the name datdir. Note that
   the value of the environment variable takes precedence over the value in
   the configuration file.<br>
   Then copy all DAT files you have into that directory. You can download DAT
   files from sites like
   <a href="http://gooddat.emu-france.com/" target="_blank">http://gooddat.emu-france.com/</a>
   or
   <a href="http://www.romcenter.com/" target="_blank">http://www.romcenter.com/</a>.
   uCON64 will automatically create index files which speed up the access to
   the DAT files dramatically. Now uCON64 uses the information inside the DAT
   files to identify or rename ROMs without an internal header.<br>
   Note that starting with version 1.9.8beta8 uCON64 doesn't have an internal
   database anymore, so you'll <b>need</b> DAT files for files like NES ROM
   dumps.<br>
<br>

<a name="36"><b>Q36</b>: Some SNES games don't work on my Super Pro Fighter Q(+).
   What can I do about that?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: First read the answer to <a href="#11">question 11</a>. The Super Pro
   Fighter Q(+) is a bit of a strange copier. You can send games (smaller than
   32 Mbit) via the parallel port by using the option -xswc. Yes, you read
   that right, the same option that is used to transfer games to a Super Wild
   Card. However, some games work better when you load them from diskette. For
   example Earthbound (after being cracked) doesn't work when loaded via the
   parallel port, but it does when loaded from diskette.<br>
   More importantly, several games need to be in Super Wild Card format in
   order for them to work correctly what SRAM concerns. So, instead of
   converting them with -fig you have to use the option -swc. For example
   Earthbound and "Lufia & The Fortress of Doom" have all sorts of problems
   when they are in FIG format, but not when they are in SWC format. Other
   games work best when you convert them with -fig. For example Seiken
   Densetsu 3 will run best (but not good) when converted with -fig.<br>
<br>
<p>
<a name="37"><b>Q37</b>: uCON64 displays too many lines for my DOS-box. What
   can I do about that?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: You can do several things:<br>
   1.) Change the number of lines that can be displayed at once with this
   command:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; mode con lines=50<br>
   2.) Use the program "more". See <a href="#27">question 27</a>.<br>
   3.) Redirect the output of uCON64 to a file. For example:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; ucon64 rom.swc &#62; output.txt<br>
   You can then open the file output.txt in an editor.<br>
<br>
<p>
<a name="38"><b>Q38</b>: When will the next version of uCON64 be released? I
   have heard the next version is able to crack my favourite SNES game, but I
   don't know how to use CVS or a compiler.</a><br>
<b>A</b>: We know when we will release a new version only just before we do so.
   But starting with uCON64 1.9.8beta8 this is not a problem for you at all.
   The only requirement is that you are able to read and use a text editor ;-)<br>
   First visit the uCON64 homepage and from there follow a link to the uCON64
   sourceforge page. You should be able to find a page where you can browse the
   CVS repository. Download the latest version of the file snes.c. Open the
   file in an editor and search for the text snes_k. If you are looking for
   NTSC or PAL fixes search either for snes_fix_pal_protection or
   snes_fix_ntsc_protection, depending on what you need. For example, you will
   have to search for snes_fix_pal_protection, if you want to fix a game so
   that it will run on an NTSC SNES.<br>
   Then read the comment to see what "code" your game requires. However, surely
   not every game will be mentioned in the comments. In that case search for
   the corresponding "line" a bit below. For example, for Mega Man X you will
   find this text in the comments:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; af/bf XX 80 00 cf/df XX 80 40 f0<br>
   =&#62; af/bf XX 80 00 cf/df XX 80 40 80<br>
   Then you could search for the sequence \x80\x40\xf0. It's just a subset of
   the search pattern with each element prefixed with "\x". Searching for
   \xaf/\xbf won't bring you far. Searching for \xXX\x80 neither. It takes a
   bit too much text to explain all the details, so just follow the directions.
   Note that I didn't advise to search for \x80\x40\x80, because that's what
   the sequence should be after uCON64 has cracked or fixed the game.<br>
   For Mega Man X you will find the lines:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; n += change_mem (buffer, bytesread, "!*\x80\x00!*\x80\x40\xf0", 9, '*', '!', "\x80", 1, 0,<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                 "\xaf\xbf", 2, "\xcf\xdf", 2);<br>
   Now open the file snescopy.txt. If you are trying to get uCON64 support new
   NTSC or PAL cracks open snesntsc.txt or snespal.txt respectively. Then copy
   the parts "!*\x80\x00!*\x80\x40\xf0", '*', '!', "\x80", 0, "\xaf\xbf" and
   "\xcf\xdf" to a new line in that file. Note that 0 is the 9th parameter.
   Also note that "\xaf\xbf" and "\xcf\xdf" are all parameters between double
   quotes after the 9th parameter.<br>
   Remove the double and single quotes and separate the parts by a colon. Then
   replace the prefix \x with a space. If you followed the directions the line
   will look like this:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; !* 80 00!* 80 40 f0: *: !:  80: 0:  af bf:  cf df<br>
   You are almost done now. Only one thing has to be done. Look at what the
   "wildcard" and "escape" symbols are. They are defined by the 5th and 6th
   parameter of change_mem(), respectively. In our example the 5th parameter is
   '*', so the wildcard character is: *. The 6th parameter is '!', so the
   escape character is: !. And now the last step: replace the wildcard and
   escape characters with a (hexadecimal) number that doesn't occur in the rest
   of the character sequence (except other wildcards and escape symbols or
   values). Be sure to have at least one space between the numbers. In our
   example we could choose the values 1 and 2. In that case the finished line
   would look like this:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; 2 1 80 00 2 1 80 40 f0: 1: 2:  80: 0:  af bf:  cf df<br>
   If for example the 5th parameter would have been \x01, the wildcard would be
   01. In that case you wouldn't have to change it, because it's already a
   number.<br>
   Now save the changed file and place it either in the directory from where
   you will run uCON64 (note that this is not necessarily the same directory as
   the one where the uCON64 executable might be located!) or in uCON64's
   configuration directory. Use the option -version to find out which directory
   that is. Then try if uCON64 is able to crack your game. uCON64 will display
   a warning message if it detects an error in your new line. If you made a
   mistake with escape symbols uCON64 might very well crash. You can use the
   switch -v (in combination with -k, -f or -l) to make uCON64 display what
   information it reads from the file.<br>
   If you can't find which line you need you will either have to add a line to
   snescopy.txt, snespal.txt or snesntsc.txt for every code that isn't already
   mentioned in those files or ask someone else to do it for you. For example
   on an emulation web forum like
   the <a href="http://www.cherryroms.com/" target="_blank">cherryroms</a>
   <a href="http://forums.cherryroms.com/viewforum.php?f=2" target="_blank">copier and hardware forum</a>.<br>

<a name="39"><b>Q39</b>: What is the format of the snes*.txt files?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: Zero or more <u>lines</u> of the following format:<br>
   &#60;search&#62; : &#60;wc&#62; : &#60;esc&#62; : &#60;new&#62; : &#60;off&#62;
   [: &#60;set&#62;]*<br>
   Where <i>search</i> is the search pattern, <i>wc</i> the wildcard value,
   <i>esc</i> the escape value, <i>new</i> the replacement byte sequence,
   <i>off</i> the offset and <i>set</i> a set of bytes for each escape value in
   the search pattern. uCON64 does not accept this information to be specified
   across several lines. All values should be specified in hexadecimal, except
   the offset.<br>
   If the search pattern doesn't contain any escape bytes, you needn't specify
   a set as it won't be used. If it does contain escape bytes you will have to
   specify a set for each one of them. Take for example the pattern:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; 01 00 01 00 42 84 ff 75 : ff : 00 : 02 03 : -6 : 22 11 : 19 75<br>
   This will match amongst 1020 others with the following byte sequences:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; 01 22 01 19 42 84 19 75<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; 01 11 01 19 42 84 91 75<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; 01 22 01 75 42 84 00 75<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; 01 11 01 75 42 84 ff 75<br>
   A wildcard value in the search pattern matches with any value.<br>
   Using the above search pattern, uCON64 will search and replace two bytes six
   bytes "back" from the end of any matched byte sequence.
   For example, any occurence of the byte sequence 01 22 01 19 42 84 19 75 will
   be changed into 01 02 03 19 42 84 19 75.
