Q: How do I compile uCON64?<br />
A: You can optionally open the Makefile in an editor and change the defines<br />
<br />
DB enables/disables the internal ROM database<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; disabled with a # in front uCON64 will be only ~250kB in size!<br />
<br />
BACKUP enables/disables support for backup units<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; disabled with a # in front<br />
<br />
Afterwards enter the following lines<br />
<br />
make -f Makefile.&#60;your&nbsp;OS&#62; clean<br />
make -f Makefile.&#60;your&nbsp;OS&#62;<br />
make -f Makefile.&#60;your&nbsp;OS&#62; install<br />
<br />
Under Unix (Linux) the last command will ask for root's password, because
uCON64 needs to be setuid root for parallel port access.<br />
Under BeOS the last command will open a dialog window. Just follow the
instructions.

Q: How do I install uCON64?<br />
A: You already did if you followed the directions in the previous answer (you
downloaded the source package). If you don't use WinDOS run
install_&#60;your&nbsp;OS&#62;.sh and edit $HOME/.ucon64rc. If you use WinDOS you may
want to copy ucon64.exe to a directory in your PATH and maybe edit ucon64.cfg.<br />
<br />
BeOS users will also need Caz's driver inside ioport.zip or available at
<a href="http://www.infernal.currantbun.com" target="_blank">http://www.infernal.currantbun.com</a><br /><br />
Under Windows NT/2000/XP you will need a driver too (giveio/userport). Have a look at

Q: Sometimes my terminal seems to be locked after I do<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; ucon64 -xswc "Super Metroid (JU).swc" | more<br />
A: You are right, it <u>seems</u> to be locked, but the only thing that happened is
that the character echoing of the terminal is disabled. Just don't do that ;-)<br />

Q: How do I specify a bank number for the GB Xchanger? This doesn't work<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; ucon64 -xgbxb&#60;0&#62; "Pokemon (Green).sav"<br />
A: You should leave out those angle brackets. This should work<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; ucon64 -xgbxb0 "Pokemon (Green).sav"<br />
</tt></p>

Q: How do I make uCON64 display only information about a ROM? When I use * I get
strange results.<br />
A: The help says that * will show info to indicate that <u>every</u> uCON64 option
will show information about a ROM. Note that sometimes you will need to specify the
console type for uCON64, because the ROM dump is damaged. For example<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; ucon64 -snes "Super Aleste (J) [t1].swc"<br />

Q: I have two parallel ports in my PC and my Flash Advance Linker is connected to the
second. However, when I try to use uCON64 to send a demo to the FAL something goes wrong.
What happened?<br />
A: Well, many things could have gone wrong, but uCON64 only detects your first parallel
port (it stops probing for a parallel port if it finds one). So, you should specify the
address of the second parallel port on the command line. For example<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; ucon64 -xfal demo.gba 0x278<br />
