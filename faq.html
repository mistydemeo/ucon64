Q: How do I compile uCON64?<br />
A: You can optionally open the Makefile in an editor and change the defines<br />
<br />
DB enables/disables the internal ROM database<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; disabled with an # in front uCON64 will be only ~250kB in size!<br />
<br />
BACKUP enables/disables support for backup units<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; disabled with an # in front<br />
<br />
Afterwards enter the following lines<br />
<br />
make -f Makefile.&#60;your OS&#62; clean<br />
make -f Makefile.&#60;your OS&#62;<br />
make -f Makefile.&#60;your OS&#62; install<br />
<br />
Under Unix (Linux) the last command will ask for root's password, because
uCON64 needs to be setuid root for parallel port access.<br />
Under BeOS the last command will open a dialog window. Just follow the
instructions.

Q: How do I install uCON64?<br />
A: You already did if you followed the directions in the previous answer (you
downloaded the source package). If you don't use WinDOS run install_&#60;your OS&#62;.sh
and edit $HOME/.ucon64rc. If you use WinDOS you might want to copy ucon64.exe to a
directory in your PATH and maybe edit ucon64.cfg.<br />
<br />
BeOS users will also need Caz's driver inside ioport.zip or available at

Under Windows NT/2000/XP you will also need a driver (giveio/userport). Have a look at

Q: Sometimes my terminal seems to be locked after I do<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; ucon64 -xswc "Super Metroid (JU).swc" | more<br />
A: You are right, it <u>seems</u> to be locked, but the only thing that happened is
that the character echoing of the terminal is disabled. Just don't do that ;-)<br />
