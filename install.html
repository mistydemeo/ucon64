Q: How do I compile uCON64?
A: You can optionally open the Makefile in an editor and change the defines

   DB     enables/disables the internal ROM database
          disabled with an # in front uCON64 will be only ~250kB in size!

   BACKUP enables/disables support for backup units
          disabled with an # in front

   Afterwards enter the following lines

   make -f Makefile.&#60;your OS&#62; clean
   make -f Makefile.&#60;your OS&#62;
   make -f Makefile.&#60;your OS&#62; install

   Under Unix (Linux) the last command will ask for root's password, because
   uCON64 needs to be setuid root for parallel port access.
   Under BeOS the last command will open a dialog window. Just follow the
   instructions.

Q: How do I install uCON64?
A: You already did if you followed the directions in the previous answer (you
   downloaded the source package).
   If you don't use WinDOS run install_&#60;your OS&#62;.sh and edit
   $HOME/.ucon64rc.
   If you use WinDOS you might want to copy ucon64.exe to a directory in your
   PATH and maybe edit ucon64.cfg.

   BeOS users will also need Caz's driver inside ioport.zip or available at
   http://www.infernal.currantbun.com

Q: Sometimes my terminal seems to be locked after I do
   ucon64 -xswc "Super Metroid (JU).swc" | more
A: You are right, it seems to be locked, but the only thing that happened is
   that the character echoing of the terminal is disabled. For the rest: just
   don't do that ;-)
