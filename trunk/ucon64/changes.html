<p><tt>
1.9.2<br />
        - started to add missing Sega System16(A/B)/System 18/dual 68000 support<br />
	- -xv64 shows now the filename on the Doctor instead of "UCON64" (sorry)<br />

          be a USB device with copyprotected MPE standard instead of MP3..

	- removed options which were added by mistake (like parallel transfer for
          Z64)<br />

          ROM)<br />
