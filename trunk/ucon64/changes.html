<title>uCON64 - Changes</title></head><body bgcolor="#ffffff"><tt><br>
The original uCON for SNES and Genesis was written by chicken & chp in ~1995<br>
<br>
<p>
<a name="190">1.9.0</a><br>
- completely re-written<br>
- this is the first real version with support for the most consoles<br>
<p>
<a name="191">1.9.1</a><br>
- bug fixes<br>
- fixed the -xv64 routine for receive and emulation on N64<br>
- cosmetical changes<br>

<p>
<a name="192">1.9.2</a><br>

- -xv64 shows now the filename on the Doctor instead of "UCON64" (sorry)<br>
- removed -xmp3 option for SongBoy (latest informations say that it will
  be a USB device with copyprotected MPE standard instead of MP3.. HAHAHAHA!!!)<br>
- TODO:  -xmp3 send MP3 file(s) to SongBoy (MP3 player for Game Boy)<br>
- removed options which were added by mistake (like parallel transfer for Z64)<br>
- added -ispad (looks for repeating bytes at the end of a probably padded ROM)<br>
- added -rn (some people might find it useful)<br>
- added -mg, -bin and 'show ROM' support for PC-Engine<br>
- added -usms for Jos Kwanten's ultraSMS an Sega Master System/GameGear
  emulator for the Nintendo64<br>

  need a filename<br>

- added database for NES roms (that enlarged the ucon64 executable by 190kb
  grnnn...) "You gotta do what you gotta do." (Futurama)<br>
- added -db and -dbv database commands... now everyone can check if the
  uCON64 version he uses has new database entries for a console system<br>
<p>
